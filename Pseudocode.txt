Pseudocode

1. Define a function to check if a number is even:
   - If the number divided by 2 has no remainder, it is even.
   
2. Define a function to check if a number has a perfect square root:
   - Calculate the square root of the number.
   - If the square root is a whole number, the number has a perfect square root.
   
3. Define a function to find all factors of a number:
   - Create an empty list to store factors.
   - For each number from 1 to the given number:
     - If the given number divided by the current number has no remainder, add the current number to the list of factors.

4. Start the main program:
   - While is true:
     - Ask the user to enter a whole number.
     - If the user input is a valid whole number:
       - Convert the input to an integer and print the number.
     - If the user input is not valid, prompt the user to try again
   
5. Check if the number is even or odd:
   - Use the even function to check and print the result.
   
6. Check if the number has a perfect square root:
   - Use the perfect square root function to check and print the result.

7. Find and print all factors of the number:
   - Use the factors function to get the list of factors.
   - Convert the list of factors to a string and print it.
   
8. Ask the user if they want to enter another number:
   - If the user enters “n”, it prints a thank you message and stops the program.
   - Otherwise, the program continues.
